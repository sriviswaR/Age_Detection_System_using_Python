# Age_Detection_System
 A real-time age detection system leveraging deep learning and attention mechanisms to accurately predict ages from facial images. The project utilizes the UTKFace dataset and integrates a custom self-attention layer with a CNN for enhanced feature extraction and focus on relevant facial regions

### Dataset Description: 
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.
<br>
It consists of: 
<br>
<ul>
<li> <b>Size and Age Range:</b> It contains over 20,000 images featuring faces across a wide age range, from 0 to 116 years old. </li>
 <li> <b>Image Variety:</b> The dataset incorporates images with variations in factors like pose, facial expressions, lighting conditions, occlusion (e.g., hair covering part of the face), and resolution. This diversity helps train algorithms to perform well in real-world scenarios.  </li>
 <li><b>Annotations:</b> Each image is labeled with the person's age, gender, and ethnicity. This additional information allows for more comprehensive tasks like demographic analysis. </li>
</ul>
